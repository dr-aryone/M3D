# Unofficial Comminity M3D Software & Spooler

## Disclaimer

This version of the software is recreated from decompiling the 1.8.3 release of the official M3D software. 

While this version of the software should work with your printer with no more trouble than the official one, you do so at your own risk. M3D does not, and cannot, support any damage that may arrise from the use of this community fork. 

While I have spoken to M3D and have received permission to share this, there are 3 things that need to be made clear regarding the use or modification of this source:

1. M3D supports open modification for personal use and not commercial endeavor or financial benefit
1. You must accept as-is. This software is not officially supported in this context
1. You must accept consequences of using open software and any impacts it may have on your printer

Now that that's out of the way...

## Introduction

Welcome to the comminuty "fork" of the M3D software and spooler. This is a "branch" off of the 1.8.3 version so we can update, add features, or attempt to make the printers work with other printer hosts.

Currently, there are very few changes to this source after the initial decompile. Necessary asjutments were made so that the decompile would build and run through Visual Studio 2017, and then some auto-cleanup was performed so that the code was a bit better style-wise. There's still a long way to go, and numerous items we can work on. 

## License

This fork is free for personal use and modification. It may not be sold. Use of the software, source, and any compiled binaries is done so at your own risk. Use of this software, properly or improperly, may break your printer. You accept full responsibility and liablity of any damages that may result should you choose to use this software.
